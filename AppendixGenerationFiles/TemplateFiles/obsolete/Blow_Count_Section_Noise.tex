\chapter{Blow count for reduced hammer energy settings Input to noise mitigation strategy}\label{sec_1}

Figure ~\ref{blow_count_Noise} presents the predicted blow count using a noise mitigation strategy
for which the pile energy is kept as low as possible and only increased when the
blow count exceeds 800 blows/m (200 blows/0.25 m), i.e. a so-called low
energy driving strategy.
